\section[Introduction]{Purpose of the document}
This document presents the whole review process to follow when a document needs revision. It aims to provide a set of guidelines as technical instructions for each review cycle launched that highlights the steps to take.The roles involved in the process are clearly identified as well as their responsibilities and tasks. And finally, the mechanisms needed to achieve the proposed objectives are also included, so the process can be carried out successfully.

\section{Structure of the repository}
 
The review process involves the creation of the following directories inside the structure of each repository. 

\todo{BerndHekele: I propose to document the status of the documents also in the ReadMe of the repository. The following information is of value: Document, review status or review plan. This information can give guidance to the repository}

\todo{BerndHekele: Abbreviation RC is missing and meaning is not clear even though the term is used all over the document}
\begin{flushleft}

\todo{BerndHekele: we need to support also reviews of different nature, e.g., MS-Word, MS-Project, MS-Excel. In this situation I propose to make the PDF file available and make use of the "traditional" review procedure. The decision on this alternative procedure must be part of the review process, i.e., part of the invitation.}

\todo{BerndHekele: a traditional review procedure as used in the section of requirements documents should be the exception, but has to be possible for documents not reasonable in text structures.}

\todo{BerndHekele: it might also be an option to introduce a light-weight review-process for not-critical documents. This process could be based on a slimmed procedure in the issue tracker (like voting or starting an issue on Git. This user guideline should show a little bit like a decision matrix how to select the right procedure.}

\todo{BerndHekele: I propose we also define a section in each document (type) showing the status of the document and the documents history (like your "Document History")}

RC manager / Owner of the document &
\begin{itemize}
\item Launch the Review Process
\begin{itemize}
\item RC Request.
\begin{itemize}
\item Justify the new RC. ({\it TI.6.3.1 New RC Request})
\end{itemize}
\item Open a review cycle for a document. To do this, create a git new branch ({\it TI.6.1.1. New RC branch}) 
\item Open a new issue for the new RC linked to the document and the review. Only the owner of the document can close the issue and he/she also be in charge of conducting the discussions and comments below the issue.  ({\it TI.6.1.2. Open issue})
\item Create the Control Sheet with the basic information related to the tasks to be done during the complete new cycle. ({\it TI.6.1.3. Complete the Control Sheet})
\item BerndHekele: In each review cycle the manger has to decide who is mandatory contributor in the review. Mandatory Contributors have to be invited (per mail or phone) personally and need to confirm participation in the requested time period (effort is covered).

\item BerndHekele: We should foresee the option of a personal meeting or a \"goto-meeting\" when inviting to intensive documents. This has to be decided at the start of the RC and may be requested later if intensive discussions are ongoing during the review.

\end{itemize}
\item Control Review Process
\begin{itemize}
\item Supervision of the work done. ({\it TI.6.1.4. Supervision of the Review Process})
\end{itemize}
\item Accept/Reject
\begin{itemize}
\item Use todonotes tool to add, verify and reject comments in the document being reviewed. ({\it TI.6.3.2 Add notes using todonotes})
\item Make changes to the document.
\item BerndHekele: after updating the document the owner shall distribute the document for a final confirmation of the changes. Typically, this process shall only allow a few days for final confirmation. This step is essential if criticial issues have been detected or discussed during the review.

\end{itemize}
\item Closing
\begin{itemize}
\item Send the notification of closing. ({\it TI.6.1.6. RC Issue closing})
\item Merge the associated RC branch into the repository master branch. ({\it TI.6.1.7. RC Branch merging})
\item Generate an established version of the document in PDF format when the review cycle is finished and store it in the directory of Final documents. ({\it TI.6.1.8. Pdf delivery})

\section{Review Process Overview}

\todo{BerndHekele: I see this document as a good basis for textual documents in the process. However, we also need to decide how we live the process for other documents like Code of formal specifications. We need to be prepared for those kind of documents before actual reviews start. We do not have to much time.}

This subject is concerned with the validation and verification of the documentation generated within the OpenETCS project.  The process shall aim to confirm that what has been produced is correct and meets the expectations of the committers as well as improving the quality of the document and its reliability; it also ensures the technical approach is appropriate before releasing the related documentation.

The Review Process refers to documents that are prone to be under review consideration because the authors have delivered its first release, some sections have been included or any committee has considered an improvement. 

This whole process is independent from the habitual work done in the repositories; so, whereas the OpenETCS members work as usually do in the master branch, the new Review Cycle shall be attached to a specific repository branch (previously created by the document owner). Then any change, comment, suggestion or improvement to do to the identified document under review, shall be done inside this RC branch and in the correspondent ‚Äòreview\_documents‚Äô directory inside the OpenETCS structure. 

In this way, the day to day work with regard to the master branch shall not be affected by the work being done in the review context; the whole review cycle for a specific document shall be linked to a specific branch of the repository. 
This is the key of the process because with this mechanism there shall be no dependencies between the ordinary work done in the project and the different review cycles launched for different documents at different times.

During their lifetime, these documents shall be involved at least in one complete Review Cycle, but it there will be as many review cycles as considered necessary. The different Review Cycles linked to each document shall be numbered and associated to their branches.   

A Review Cycle will help the project to better meet its strategic goals and objectives, so the correctness of the deliverables is ensured and they cover their intended purpose.

In this context the review will help to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify deficiencies that shall be fixed. Reviewing a document in a structured way will identify problems or faults with that product. Applying a methodology for reviews shall take advantage of the expertise and knowledge of the committers involved with a greater proportion of improvements and defects found.
\item Ensure the coherence, correct use of language and appropriate structure.
\item Collect recommendations and improvements suggested by the committers so the document is enriched with specific experiences and multiple points of view and technical perspectives.
\end{itemize}

The key aspects of the review process include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Each review need for a document shall be translated into the creation of a new review cycle}
\begin{itemize}
\item A RC for a document starts when a need or objective to be fulfilled is identified.
\item Such proposal can be done by the owner of the document or by any committer that can justify the need for a new cycle. 
\item When a proposal is submitted by a person who is not the owner of the document, the review proposal shall be accepted by the owner of the document and the process shall begin.
\item BerndHekele: review cycles are timeboxed. When starting the cycle the review plan and the end date for the review need to be confirmed.
 
\end{itemize}
\item \underline{The owner of the document shall be the RC manager}
\begin{itemize}
\item The owner of the document to be reviewed shall be the responsible for addressing and conducting the review during the expected time of the cycle. 
\item He/she shall be aware of the tasks that are their responsibility, so the review is under control, the steps defined in the technical procedure are correctly followed and known, and it can be conducted with minor incidents. 
\end{itemize}

\item \underline{Close collaboration between the RC manager and the reviewers}
\begin{itemize}
\item The participants in the review shall be guided by the RC manager in the whole process so the optimum level of collaboration and integration is reached. 
\item Any conflict detected when uploading the review in the repository, question or problem found by any reviewer at any moment shall be communicated via the opened issue thread, and the RC manager shall be responsible for providing the appropriate support.
\end{itemize}

\item \underline{The documentation needed for performing the review shall be always accessible in an easy way.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Once the issue announcing the new Review Cycle has been published, the participants can have access to the needed information and documentation in the review\_documents directory.
\item Each Review Cycle identified for a document shall have a detailed Control Sheet with all the information needed, the tasks assigned when there is not an open a general review, the objectives to meet, deadlines, etc. support.
\end{itemize}

\item \underline{The review shall be done locally by the reviewers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using the Smartgit tool the reviewers shall ensure that they have switched their work context to the required RC branch and then synchronize the contents so they have the last committed version of the review\_directory.
\item The reviewers shall work in the cloned repository that contains the document under review locally 
\item They shall use the todonotes package installed for the LaTeX editing tool to include comments and suggestions into the document under review
\end{itemize}

\item \underline{The reviewer is responsible for uploading the changes to the remote branch}
\begin{itemize}
\item Once the work is done, the reviewer shall ensure he/she has the last committed version of the document under review before pushing the changes into the correspondent git repository. 
\item The conflicts that can appear due to simultaneous work in the same document shall be resolved before merging the changes into the document under review. 
\item When the review is uploaded the reviewer shall notify the actualization by sending a message in the opened issue thread.
\item The reviewer shall wait for the RC manager to approve or reject the proposed changes.
\end{itemize}

\item \underline{The RC manager shall decide when the Review Process is closed}
\begin{itemize}
\item The reviewer shall receive a notification by e-mail, and publicly in the opened related issue, once the RC manager has checked the proposed review. 
\item The reviewers shall continue working with the document in case there are still pending issues.
\item When there are no more pending issues, neither comments nor suggestions to be done, the review process is finished. Then, the RC manager shall be the responsible for 
\begin{itemize}
\item closing the corresponding issue in the repository, 
\item sending the notification of closing, 
\item merging the associated RC branch into the repository master branch, 
\item generating an established new version of the document 
\item and uploading it into the Final documents directory in the repository.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

There can be in the git repository different intermediate versions in pdf of the document under review in the review\_documents directory. However, this pdf document can be used only as a quick reference of the progress of the review, and it cannot be taken as a final document. 

It is important to have in mind that the document under review, once it has been verified and approved by the RC manager, shall be available in the Final documents directory.

In the Final documents directory of each WP inside the structure of the OpenETCS project there shall be always a readable version for anyone in the project. 

When comparisons between correlative stable versions of a document need to be done, the diffPDF tool cab be used to find the differences between them.


\section{Technical Instructions}

In this section the whole Review process is explained step by step using technical instructions, so all the participants involved in the process are aware of the mechanisms they shall implement to work and achieve the expected objectives. 

The sequence of activities or course of action that must be followed by the reviewers as well as the RC manager is explained below.
