\hline
Revision Process &
The OpenETCS committers are invited to perform a revision of the contents of a document. The committers can edit the document, writing complete sections or making changes directly in it (LaTex, todonotes and Smartgit tools). The author(s) shall support the whole process answering questions and resolving conflicts. Once the author(s) and committers are satisfied with the results, the Product owner shall confirm and approve or reject and request more changes to the revised document. Finally, the approved document is pushed into the corresponding GitHub repository.
\\\hline
Review Process &
Any person involved in the GitHub communnity and/or the OpenETCS project is invited to participate in a Review Process. They shall not edit the document but send comments and suggestions creating the corresponding issues in the {\it Issue Tracker} tool. Once the deadline has arrived, the author(s) shall collect the comments and make the changes they consider appropriate. Any doubt shall be answered by the reviewers using the issue threads opened and in case of conflicts the collaboration of the Product owner may be required. The process may be launched after a Revision Process ends, there are relevant issues reported for a release or whenever the Product owner considers appropriate. 
\\\hline
Product owner &
The role played by the main author of a document or the project leader. The responsibilities of the role include launching a Review Process, inviting Reviewers to the process, closing discussions, taking decisions when there are conflicts and doing the final approval of the document among others.
\\\hline
Committer &
The role played by a member of the OpenETCS project who have been granted with this role by other committers and the project leader. There are some tasks that only can be done by committers such as: editing and pushing changes or new documents into a GitHub repository, closing of issues in the {\it Issue Tracker} or being involved in Revision processes.
\\\hline
Reviewer &
Any person of the community who is interested in providing feedback, reporting issues or propose improvements to a document. The reviewers can be involved in a specific Review process or open issues in an independent way. In any case they shall know the {\it Issue Tracker} tool to make their comments, be questioned by the Author(s) in case of doubts or be informed about the decisions taken regarding the implementation or not of changes due to the issues found.

\subsection{Description of the Review Process}

The documents review process aims to collect verifiable data and information in an independent way, and the process provides an overall improvement of the contents and/or format of the document, so accurate and up-to-date documents with increased credibility are obtained.

The Review process allows the OpenETCS project to ensure that the information contained in a document is independently verifiable. The process can be done without needing to solicit extensive input
from other sources and it is typically less expensive than collecting the data using other methods.

The objectives to accomplish in any Review are the following ones:

\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate the next aspects
\begin{itemize}
\item Accuracy
\item Completeness
\item Conciseness
\end{itemize}
\item Reduce the defect percentage
\item Improve the quality of documents
\begin{itemize}
\item Focus on correcting the defects
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

To accomplished a successful process the role of the participants shall be clear and their involvement active. This document will help the reviewers to understand their roles and
activities to practice effective and efficient reviews; and on the other hand, the author(s) to comprehend the importance of checking periodically the {\it Issue Tracker} tool to answer the reviewers as soon as possible, so they feel attended and their feedback valued.

The reviewers shall verify technical details and could share their vision with other reviewers participating in different discussions held in the {\it Issue Tracker}. 

The Review shall be focused on the work product and whenever additional help is needed the Author(s) shall be available to answer questions. Only in case there are conflicts or no agreements are reached, the Product owner shall be required to close the pending issues.

Finally, the Product owner shall evaluate the state of the document once the Review has finished and decide whether the new version deserves a new release for the document, or it is rejected due to minor changes still pending to be implemented (The review process continue) or further improvements are identified and a Revision process needs to be launched to modify the document accordingly.

The Review Process refers to documents that are prone to be under review consideration because:

\begin{itemize}
\item After a Revision Process has finished
\item There is a release of a document and in the {\it Issue Tracker} there are a set of relevant issues to that release. A Review process shall be started to collect more issues.
\item There is a special situation because of that the Product owner considers to begin a Review Process 
\end{itemize}

The following diagram provides a general overview of the process. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{./figures/ReviewProcess.JPG}
\caption{Review Process flow}
\end{figure}

During their lifetime, these documents shall be involved at least in one complete Review Process, but it there will be as many Review Processes launched as considered necessary.    

The process is divided in the following stages

\subsubsection{Review Process Launching}

Having the document reviewers work together from a shared space (GitHub {\it Issue Trucker}) increases productivity and accuracy. They can ask questions as they come up and the author(s) can give the answers to all reviewers at once.

The reviewers can participate in a review in two different ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item The product owner of a document launches a Review Process creating an issue in the {\it Issue Tracker}. The issue shall contain basic information about the document, the objectives to accomplish, and the deadline. Any person of the community is invited to participate, so the reviewer only has to answer the issue indicating his/her interest in collaborating.
\item There is not an ongoing Review Process for a document, but a person who has read a document has found some issues he/she wants to report. The reviewer can open a new issue in the {\it Issue Tracker} to notify the findings; depending on the severity and category of the defects detected or improvements identified, the Product owner can decide to open a Review Process, or directly ask the author(s) for implementing the appropriate changes without launching the process.
\end{itemize}

The document shall be available in a readable format (PDF) so any reviewer can have access to it, and the correctly path to download it shall be provided.

The launching of the Review process shall consist on the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Product owner should assess whether there are any specific reviewer he/she is interested in inviting due to his/her knowledge in an area. In this case, the Product owner shall notify personally via e-mail the opening of the Review Process and the invitation to collaborate.
\item Specify a deadline for the Process.
\item The Product owner shall be the responsible for addressing and conducting the main aspects of the Review. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The critical decisions regarding the process shall be taken by this role (closing of issues when no agreements have been reached and conflicts solving).
\item But the process itself shall be mainly supported by the Author(s), so any problem, doubt or question the reviewers have about the process or contents of the document must be asked to the Author(s) using the {\it Issue Tracker} tool. 
\item The Product owner shall be aware of the progress of the Review, so it is under control. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

From this moment, the last version of the document that can be a \underline{Revised document} or a \underline{Released document} is put {\it \underline{In Review}}.

\subsubsection{Review Stage}

Any person involved in the community and the OpenETCS project can be a reviewer at any time, when there is a Review process launched, and when it is not.

\begin{itemize}
\item In case there is a Review process ongoing, the difference is that the Reviewers shall consider the deadline defined for reporting issues, and in that time, they can share their findings and promote discussions so the best solution for a problem is agreed. 
\item In case there is not a Review process launched, the reviewer shall wait for the Author(s) to answer the issue(s) reported and decide whether they shall be considered and a solution implemented or not. In any case, the Author(s) shall justify their decision.
\end{itemize}

The Author(s) shall be aware about the issues and be available to answer the questions asked during the discussions between different reviewers or provide support to a specific reviewer when required.

On the other hand, the Reviewers shall also check the {\it Issue Tracker} to read the answers provided by the Author(s) or clarify their doubts regarding the issues found.

The only tool available during the Process is the {\it Issue Tracker} available in GitHub. The Reviewers are responsible for learning its functionalities and options and being sure they do an appropriate use of it.

It is highly recommended the Reviewers group the issues found in categories by similarity and report each group in a different issue. In this way, the issues shall be easier to follow and assess and the  {it Issue Tracker} more organised.

When the document under review is an intensive or complex one, or there is a considerable number of questions or doubts between the Reviewers, the Product owner or the Author(s) can propose online meetings to solve them.  

By defect, the period of time for the Review Stage must not exceed two weeks.

The stage implies the following \underline{key points}:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Reviewers shall communicate to the Author(s) their interest in participating in an opened Review Process adding a comment to the corresponding issue. 
\item The {\it Issue Tracker} shall be the main tool to make comments and suggestions, as well as receive answers and discuss subjects.
\item The issues must be labelled, so the Author(s) can prioritize them and organize the Stage of implementation.
\item The Reviewers shall check there are not other issues reported that deal with the same subjects they want to publish.
\end{itemize}

\underline{A successful Review lies in}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Reviewers' ability to communicate issues as well as their ability to collaborate with the Author(s) or other Reviewers. 
\item The Reviewers have in mind the deadline in case there is a Review Process and they do the review in the period established.
\item Whenever it is necessary the Reviewers shall ask for support from the Author(s)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Stage}

Once the deadline arrives in a Review process launched, or there are some issues reported in the {\it Issue Tracker} that have been considered as adequate, the Implementation Stage begins.

The Author(s) shall be the responsible for collecting the issues reported in the {\it Issue Tracker} organising and prioritizing them so they can assess whether new implementations or changes are needed.

During a specify period of time (approximately one week), the Author(s) shall implement the changes, contact the Reviewers in case of doubts, and inform the Reviewers when the Implementation phase has finished.

The Author(s) shall prepare a new version of the document and push it into the corresponding GitHub repository. They shall inform the Reviewers they have a couple of days to make comments to that version so minor adjustments can be done and then the Stage shall be closed.

The Author(s) are responsible for using the appropriate editing tools to include the changes as well as providing a correct upload of the new version to the repository.

\subsubsection{Approval Stage}

Now that the Review stage is completed, the Approval stage begins. 

During this stage, the \underline{Product owner} can resolve duplicate or
conflicting information and requests. He/she shall be required to assess the state of the document, so the Author(s) shall provide a list of the issues reported, a list of the issues implemented and the last version of the document to the Product Owner.

If required, more information can be requested from the Author(s) or Reviewers about a
particular aspect of the Review. 

The Product Owner shall evaluate carefully the Review of the document, the changes made and the current contents. Then The Product owner shall decide:

\begin{itemize}
\item To Approve the document
\begin{itemize}
\item The document satisfies the expectations, the contents are good and the changes made appropriate. 
\item The Approval stage finishes and the Product owner makes the closing.
\end{itemize}
\item The document still have minor defects, errors or improvements. The Product Owner shall notify the Author(s) the changes he/she require(s) and provide a deadline for the implementation. After that, he/she shall analyse again the state of the document and decide whether it deserves to be approved or not.
\item There are pending issues that cannot be resolved in a Review or further improvements are needed. The Review has found that the structure, main contents or several sections need a deep Revision. In this way, the Product owner closes the Review notifying it to the Reviewers (in the Review issue or personally in each issue reported in the {\it Issue Tracker} and launches a complete \underline{Revision Process} to involve committers.
\end{itemize}

Whatever decision is made, it shall be justified by the Product owner and communicated to the Author(s) and Reviewers.

\subsubsection{Closing}

A Review process or a review made by one or more Reviewers without a Review process shall be closed when:

\begin{itemize}
\item The document review has been approved
\item The document shall be revised deeply by the Committers and the Author(s), so the Review shall be closed and another Review opened once the new Revision is done.
\end{itemize} 

In case the document has been approved, the Product owner prepares the version (in LaTex and PDF) and pushed both documents to GitHub with the appropriate version numbering. This document shall be available as a \underline{Release}.

In any case, the Product owner shall close the corresponding issue in the repository (if it exists) or confirming the closing adding comments to each issue reported.
