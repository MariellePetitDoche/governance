\hline
Revision Process &
The OpenETCS Committers and potential Contributors are invited to perform a revision of the contents of a document. The Committers can edit the document, writing complete sections or making changes directly in it (LaTex, todonotes and Smartgit tools). The Contributors cannot edit the document but they can send their contributions using the {\it Issue Tracker} tool. The Author(s) shall support the whole process answering questions and resolving conflicts. Once the Author(s) and Committers/Contributors are satisfied with the results, the Product owner shall confirm and approve or reject and request more changes to the revised document. Finally, the approved document is pushed into the corresponding GitHub repository.
\\\hline
Review Process &
Any person involved in the GitHub communnity and/or the OpenETCS project is invited to participate in a Review Process. They shall not edit the document but send comments and suggestions creating the corresponding issues in the {\it Issue Tracker} tool. Once the deadline has arrived, the Author(s) shall collect the comments and make the changes they consider appropriate. Any doubt shall be answered by the reviewers using the issue threads opened and in case of conflicts the collaboration of the Product owner may be required. The process may be launched after a Revision Process ends, there are relevant issues reported for a release or whenever the Product owner considers appropriate. 
\\\hline
RC &
Revision Cycle - A complete cycle with an established deadline (one or two weeks maximum) where the Author(s) and the Committers/Contributors can read, analyse and make suggestions or changes directly to the document under revision. Once the document is approved the cycle finishes and a new version shall be available in the corresponding GitHub repository.
\\\hline
Product owner &
The role played by the main Author of a document or the project leader. The responsibilities of the role include launching a Revision process, inviting Committers/Contributors to the process, closing discussions, taking decisions when there are conflicts and doing the final approval of the document among others.
\\\hline
Committer &
The role played by a member of the OpenETCS project who have been granted with this role by other Committers and the project leader. There are some tasks that only can be done by Committers such as: editing and pushing changes or new documents into a GitHub repository, closing of issues in the {\it Issue Tracker} or being involved in Revision processes.
\\\hline
Contributor &
The role played by people who are not Committers for a specific project but they have appropriate knowledge and demonstrable skills in several areas. Their contributions are interesting for the document under revision and they shall be considered in the Revision context. Contributors have only read or {\it Pull} access rights. Both ({\it Committers} and {\it Contributors}) sign some kind of IPR agreement if they contribute in a larger extend (>200 characters) to the repository. {\it Committers} and potential {\it Contributors} who are coming from one of project partners, are covered by the Project Cooperation Agreement signed by their employer; however other type of {\it Contributors} might be an open issue. Smaller contributions up to 200 characters are considered {\it minor} and that is covered by the {\it Terms of Use} of the openETCS.org website and repository.

\subsection{Description of the Revision Process}

This subject is concerned with the validation and verification of the documentation generated within the OpenETCS project. The process shall aim to confirm that what has been produced is correct and meets the expectations of the Committers and Contributors as well as improving the quality of the document and its reliability; it also ensures the technical approach is appropriate before releasing the related documentation.

A Revision Cycle will help the project to better meet its strategic goals and objectives, so the correctness of the deliverables is ensured and they cover their intended purpose.The following aspects shall be assessed during the Revision Process:

\begin{itemize}
\item The material is technically accurate
\item The goals of the document have been achieved
\item Quality, style and grammar (do not forget the spell check)
\item Document uses consistent tense
\item Document addresses the audience appropriately
\item Sentences use simple structures
\item Unnecessary information is eliminated
\item Does the reader leave wanting more?
\item Internal cross-reference within the document is accurate
\item References to other existing documents are valid
\end{itemize}

The Revision Process refers to documents that are prone to be under revision consideration because:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Authors have delivered its first version
\item After a Review Process has finished and there are major changes and improvements to be done in the document by the Author(s), Committers and potential Contributors. 
\item The Product owner has justified a new revision. 
\end{itemize}

The following diagram provides a general overview of the process. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{./figures/RevisionProcess.JPG}
\caption{Revision-Review Processes flow}
\end{figure}


This whole process is independent from the habitual work done in the repositories; so, whereas the OpenETCS members work as usually do in the master branch, the new Revision Cycle shall be attached to a specific repository branch (previously created by the Product owner). Then any change, comment, suggestion or improvement to do to the identified document under revision, shall be done inside this RC branch and in the correspondent {\it Revision Documents} directory inside the OpenETCS structure. 

In this way, the day to day work with regard to the master branch shall not be affected by the work being done in the Revision context; the whole revision cycle for a specific document shall be linked to a specific branch of the repository. 
This is the key of the process because with this mechanism there shall be no dependencies between the ordinary work done in the project and the different Revision cycles launched for different documents at different times.

During their lifetime, these documents shall be involved at least in one complete Revision Cycle, but it there will be as many Revision Cycles as considered necessary. The different Revision Cycles linked to each document shall be numbered and associated to their branches.   

The process is divided in the following stages

\subsubsection{Document Creation Stage}

After the Author(s) has completed the initial draft of a document, it must be made available to the Committers/Contributors involved in the Revision Process. 

The document shall be pushed into the corresponding GitHub repository in the appropriate formats (PDF, LaTex, etc).

Having the document in a format that is viewable online in GitHub provides the highest degree of access from both local and remote locations. 

The most common online formats for documents in OpenETCS project are LaTex and PDF. Each has its own advantages and, to an extent, disadvantages. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{LaTex documents}
\begin{itemize}
\item They are supported by multiple opensource tools, text processors and other editing packages. 
\item It is generally easy to publish and provide access to remote users via GitHub, as well as being the most familiar format to online users.
\item LaTex provides the standard formatting and font size thanks to the use of OpenETCS Latex templates. 
\end{itemize}
\item \underline{PDF documents}
\begin{itemize}
\item The other common format is PDF. This requires the Adobe Acrobatâ¢ software be installed on the Authors' and Committers'/Contibutors' PC, but provides the advantage of preserving the look and feel of the original document. 
\item PDFs are also familiar to online users and are viewable in a Web browser, although it is not possible in the GitHub context.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For this first version the \underline{Product owner} shall be clearly identified:
\begin{itemize}
\item The main Author 
\item Or the project leader 
\end{itemize}

And he/she shall be the responsible for launching the Revision process and taking decisions related to the approval of the revised version of the document.

\subsubsection{Revision Stage}

The launching of the Revision process shall consist on the creation of a new {\it Revision Cycle} by the Product owner:
\begin{itemize}
\item When starting the cycle the Revision plan and the deadline shall be clear.  
\item The Product owner shall contact the Committers who have specific knowledge and appropriate experience and invite them to the process. At least, the list shall involve the Committers of the project where the document is localised. 
\item Identify main Committers and potential Contributors to be involved; at least one name shall be obtained.
\item Prepare a private e-mail for each of the identified Committers/Contributors highlighting the purpose of the Revision and what is expected from his/her collaboration.
\item Specify a deadline for confirmation so the Revision Process is not delayed.
\item The Product owner shall be the responsible for addressing and conducting the main aspects of the Revision during the expected time of the cycle. 
\item The Product owner shall be aware of the progress of the Revision, so it is under control. 
\end{itemize}

The concept of the Revision stage is simple, but it can be time consuming and error prone.

Only confirmed Committers shall be involved in a Revision Process with documents editing and modifying rights. They shall be registered people with appropriate knowledge and skills to be capable of assessing and revising a document. 

On the other hand, Contributors can collaborate in the process, after being personally invited or freely confirming their interest in being involved due to their experience in some areas. The {\it Issue Tracker} or the e-mail should be used to confirm or notify the participation.  

Whenever a Contributor is required to be involved in the process and he/she is not a Commiter, changing his role to Committer can be possible. Then, a request shall be prepared by the Product owner to launch a voting process in the project. Once the person has been confirmed as a Committer, he/she can edit documents in the Revision Process. 

Any other type of reviewers shall be involved only in the Review Process. 

The process is limited to determined number of {\it Author(s)} and {\it Committers} that can edit a document and push the changes to a GitHub repository. 

During the Revision process, the Author(s), Committers and Contributors generally benefit
from collaborating with each other, improving their productivity; and in most cases, they will convey the errors, corrections, and suggestions they want in the document. The participants in the revision shall be guided by the Product owner during the whole process so the optimum level of integration is reached. 

The conflicts that can appear due to simultaneous work in the same document shall be resolved before merging the changes into the document under Revision. So any conflict detected, question or problem found at any moment could be communicated using the {\it Issue Tracker} tool or sending an email. The Author(s) and/or the Product owner shall be responsible for providing the appropriate support.

The revision shall be done locally by the Author(s)/Committers/Contributors and once they are satisfied with the changes push them to GitHub (Author(s)/Committers) or create issues (Contributors). Author(s)/Committers can use the Smartgit tool and ensure they have switched their work context to the required RC branch. After this, then should synchronize the contents (so they have the last committed version of the document) and push their revision. The Author(s) and Committers can use the todonotes package to include comments and suggestions into the document or highlight new sections or paragraphs.

Contributors cannot edit the document under revision so their environment of work shall consist only on pulling the last version of the document (made by Author(s) or Committers) and send their Contributors using the {\it Issue Tracker} tool. 

When the document under revision is an intensive or complex one, the Product owner or the Author(s) can propose online meetings to solve pending issues.  

When a revision is pushed to GitHub by a Committer, the update shall be notified by sending a message to the Revision team.

The issues sent by Contributors shall be available for reading in the {\it Issue Tracker}

The stage implies the following \underline{key points}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Contributors shall open issues in the {\it Issue Track} to include their contributions.
\item Committers 
\begin{itemize}
\item Committers must communicate to the Author(s) they have made changes to a document. 
\item Addressing the process with the use of the Smartgit tool, or any equivalent tool, to push the changes to a GitHub repository shall provide an
adequate history of the changes. At any moment there shall be available only one document and not different versions of it made by different people involved. 
\item With the todonotes tool the changes made in the document should be highlighted, so any reader can identify them easily and a consistent final confirmation of changes shall be made by the Product owner. This is essential when a considerable number of Committers are involved, because otherwise, the confusion becomes even greater.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

At the end of the Revision Process and once the Committers, Contributors and Author(s) are satisfied with the results, the Process owner shall be required to finally confirm and approve the version, so it can be pushed into the GitHub repository with the corresponding numbering modified.

\underline{To summarize a successful Revision cycle lies in}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Committersâ and Contributors' ability to communicate changes as well as their ability to collaborate together. 
\item Committers and Contributors can benefit from seeing what others have done.
\item By knowing who has requested a change, and why, Committers/Contributors can leverage the work of one another. This prevents multiple members of the same revision team from notifying the Author of the same error, or some other correction.
\item Once this process is complete, the Author(s)then notify the \underline{Product owner} responsible for document the approval,the next stage in the Revision process.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Approval Stage}

Now that the Revision stage is completed, the approval stage begins. 

During this stage, the \underline{Product owner} can resolve duplicate or conflicting information and requests.

If required, more information can be requested from a Committer about a particular aspect of the revision. 

The changes made are then either confirmed or rejected with a justification.

When the changes and corrections have been accepted, then any comment made using todonotes or text highlighted shall be deleted so a clear version of the document is obtained.

\subsubsection{Closing}

The Product owner prepares the version (in LaTex and PDF) and pushed both documents to GitHub with the appropriate version numbering. 

He/she shall be also the responsible for closing the corresponding issue in the repository (if it exists) or confirming the closing via e-mail to all the Author(s) and Committers/Contributors involved. 

He shall merge the associated RC branch into the repository {\it master branch} so the changes are officially available in the main branch of the repository.


\section{ANNEXES - Technical Instructions}

In this section the whole Revision process is explained step by step using technical instructions, so all the participants (Author(s), Committers and Contributors) involved in the process are aware of the mechanisms they shall implement to work and achieve the expected objectives.

Description &
The Author(s) shall study each proposal, recommendation or comment that appears in the document under revision and decide how to implement the proposed changes in case he/she estimates it is appropriate to be included in the document. On the other hand, and considering the Committers could include text in the document, the Author(s) shall assess the appropriateness of those sections and decide if this new content is accurate and relevant. When the contributions come from Contributors their issues shall be assessed due to they do not have editing rights.
\\\hline
Steps &
\begin{itemize}
\item When a Committer notifies that some changes have been pushed to GiThub using the corresponding RC branch, the Author(s) synchronizes their repository to obtain the last commit made for the document with the {\it SmartGit} tool.
\item The Author(s) reads carefully any annotation that appears in the document and decides whether the comments shall be implemented or not.
\item For each annotation the Author(s) find(s) in the document, a written confirmation about what is the decision about the subject shall be provided.

\item Use the {\it todonotes} to confirm/reject proposals made by the Committers ({\it TI.4.2 Add notes using todonotes}) or to accept/delete new sections, text or paragraphs added by the Committers.
\item In any case, a justification for that decision shall be included.
\item When a suggestion is accepted:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assess whether the recommendation made implies writing new paragraphs, sections, adding new figures, etc. and modify the document accordingly. 
\item Highlight the new text or the modified text with {\it todonotes} using the {\it inline} option.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Whenever a Contributor has added comments to an opened issue or has created a new one with contributions using the {\it Issue Tracker} tool, the Author(s) shall collect all the contributions reported, and assess the implementation of changes. The process shall be the same as in case of Committers but the tool to be in contact with the Contributor shall be the {\it Issue Tracker}.
\item The Author(s)commits the changes made in the document and push them into the RC branch so the Committers/Contributors can have access to the changes, confirmations and rejections made by the Author(s).
\item The Author(s) add(s) a message to the RC issue thread (if it exists) or send(s) an e-mail, so everyone can be informed about the commit recently done.
