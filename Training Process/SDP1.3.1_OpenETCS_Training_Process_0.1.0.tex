\section{Training Process overview}

The stakeholders perform tasks that can cause significant environmental or compliance impacts; because of that, they shall be competent on the basis of appropriate education, training and/or experience. Such stakeholders will receive specialized training when needed to be more proficient in addressing significant environmental aspects they are involved with in their work. 

This training will consist in training units that have different formal or informal courses, webinars, conferences and so on.

Training units will be consisted in three different types of trainings:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{\it Self-training}: The Stakeholders will use the available material to do a self-formation. A Tutor will be available to help them to solve doubts and correct the exercises they do.
\item \underline{\it Formal training}: The Stakeholders will receive formal formation from a Trainer with exercises and examples
\item \underline{\it Informal training}: The Stakeholders will attend to webinars, conferences or small training units.
\end{itemize}

The Training process begins as a result of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assessing skills by the QA manager to monitor and to detect the training needs. When a need is identified, QA will give the necessary instructions to the Product Owner to start the training process steps. 
\item Project training needs detection. Each time the Product Owner detects a need he/she will start the training process steps
\item Asking by the Stakeholders for tools or task training. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Roles}

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Stage One: Analyze}

\begin{itemize}
\item The analyze stage clarifies the instructional problem, establishes the instructional goals and objectives and identifies the learners' existing knowledge and skills. The most important skills to consider should be: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Attitudes
\item Current skills
\item Skill training gap
\item Skill relevancy to tasks
\end{itemize}
With these skills will be established:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project mission
\item Project strategy
\item Core competency needs
\end{itemize}
\item During the analyze stage the Product Owner will carry out:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis of needs and skills: knowledge and skills required to undertake each work. The information collected is used to provide an overarching view of the necessary skills and knowledge needed for to effectively carry out the assigned tasks. In order to help with this step the Product owner must fulfill the Training Needs Matrix form {\it{(See Appendice \ref{App:Training-Needs-Matrix})}}.
\item Analysis of the training requirements: Training needs analysis maps the current competencies of the members against the skills and knowledge required for the roles played by them in the project. They are assessed against these requirements and rated on a scale that ranges from ‚Äúneeds development‚Äù to ‚Äúable to train others.‚Äù
\item Assessment of viability of training provision to enhance productivity
\item Identification and prioritization of the knowledge, skill gaps and training requirements
\end{itemize}
\item QA manager with the Product Owner, will ensure that qualifications are coherent with the responsibilities defined for the stakeholder‚Äôs role as needed for openETCS conformance and for identifying training needs. Qualifications should specify level and type of education, amount and type of experience, previous training, and special skills
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stage Two: Design}

\begin{itemize}
\item In the designing stage the Product Owner defines learning objectives, assessment instruments, and knowledge units. During this stage the Product Owner should: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Design the objectives for developing a quality curricula
\item Select the Trainers. They could be either from different domains within OpenETCS project keeping in view their level of competency in the field of training or also external trainers can be called in the OpenETCS project keeping in view their market reputation and cost of training
\item Define the previous required skills and qualifications to attend the courses. This step will be carried out with the help of the Trainer
\item Establish the audience of the courses
\item Create the Training Methods: define the way that the TU will be taught. This will be carried out with the collaboration of the Trainer.
\item Develop an evaluation plan: method used to test and content inside the training units are evaluated in order to control the effectiveness, stakeholder progress and performance, apply feedback to modify or enhance the TU. With this information the QA Manager and Product Owner will create an evaluation report in which the whole formation process will be evaluated considering each developed register.
\item Create a satisfaction survey form in order to have the opinion of the Stakeholders about the received TU. {\it {(See Appendice \ref{App:Satisfaction-Survey-form})}}
\item Create the training plan.
\end{itemize}
\item During this stage the Trainer, with the supervision of the Product Owner, should:
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop the Training Techniques
\item Do recommendations to solving issues and constraints
\item Establish the minimum required task to do to achieve the objective of the TU successfully.
\end{itemize}

\item Training Units material, demos and resources will be available.
\end{itemize}
\item Training Units schedule and location will be confirmed. To do these steps the Trainer, Product Owner and Stakeholders will be in contact.
\begin{itemize}
\item Doodle tool will be used with this purpose.
\end{itemize}
\item Training plan will be updated and completed with all the acquired information in order to close it.
\item Product Owner will develop the evaluation system with the collaboration of the QA Manager.
\item Finally, QA manager with the Product Owner will ensure that the development phase fulfill every designing criteria. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stage Four: Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item During this phase the Stakeholders for the TUs will be contacted by the Product Owner to give them the schedule and agenda. Afterwards the training units will be taught in the schedule and location established and with the available material described in the development stage.
\item The Trainer will maintain the Attendance Record of each Stakeholder. {\it {(See Appendice \ref{App:Attendance-Record})}}
\item The Product Owner will maintain Training Records for each stakeholder. The training records will include information on the following: stakeholder‚Äôs name; Job title; Job description, Title of training unit, and Date employee completed the training. {\it {(See Appendice \ref{App:Training-Record})}} that contains the Training Record Form. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stage Five: Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
\item During this stage will be evaluated the TU according to the evaluation plan included in the training plan
\item The Product Owner will send the Stakeholders the satisfaction survey. With the obtained evaluation of the Stakeholders the Product Owner will evaluate the survey results.
\begin{itemize}
\item If the Trainer is from different domains within OpenETCS project the Trainer will review the results of the satisfaction survey and up to date it.
\item For external Trainers the satisfaction survey is sent to them in order to up to date the TU the next time that the TU is taught.  
\end{itemize}
\item The Trainer will send the Product Owner feedback information about Stakeholders, this information is introduced in a Trainer Feedback Report as well as the results from each Stakeholders of the TU. {\it {(See Appendice \ref{App:Trainer-Feedback-Report})}}. With this information the Product Owner will evaluate the fulfillment of the objectives of the training process and will create the Training Evaluation report. {\it {(See Appendice \ref{App:Training-Evaluation-Report})}}
\item Finally, QA Manager review that every register has been fulfilled satisfactorily and the content of each of them is analyzed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Training Needs Matrix
\item Training Records
\item Attendance Record
\item Trainer Feedback Report
\item Satisfaction Surveys
\item Training Storage Records
\item Evaluation report
\end{itemize}
With all the information the Training Evaluation report will be completed if it is needed. This may contain any weakness remained in any Stakeholder by the respective QA manager
\item Futhermore, QA manager will periodically review records of competency training to ensure that all the stakeholders who need specialized training have received the required training. In the case that a Stakeholder has not received or completed the required training, communicating the non-conformance to the Product Owner. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stage Six: Storage}
\begin{itemize}
\item During this final stage the Product owner will maintain and save a register containing the training unit material. This material will be categorized, and it will include information like Title of training unit, contact person, recommendations among others. {\it {(See Appendice \ref{App:Training-Storage-Report})}} that contains the form to be fulfilled to correctly identify the saved material.
\item QA Manager has to review that the Storage Register is fulfill correctly with all the created training units and every form has been fill completely and correctly
