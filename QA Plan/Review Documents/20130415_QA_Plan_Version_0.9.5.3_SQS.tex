\section[Introduction]{Introduction}


\subsection{Purpose}
%\textcolor{red}{Proposed content}
\textit{Proposed Content: This document contains the procedures and control methods to achieve the end products of the OpenETCS project with the desired levels of safety and quality. It also describes the processes, methods and tools to develop such products in accordance to CENELEC Standards and following Open Source principles.}

\subsection{Scope}

The OpenETCS main objective is the development of an ``open proofs'' platform that integrates technologies from various stakeholders and enables the use of formal verification techniques in order to dramatically improve the software quality for embedded control systems in terms of reliability, maintainability, safety, and security.

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: Since their have been long discussions concerning the goal the first sentence showed by revised. It is unclear what a "open proofs'' platform should be.}

The openETCS results will be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Creating a formal specification of the ETCS OBU functionality according to UNISIG Subset 026

\item An executable software package generated from the formal specification and a non-vital implementation of that software for laboratory test, simulation and reference purposes

\item A tools chain supporting both previous bullet points including code, test case and document generation meeting CENELEC EN50128:2011 (T3) requirements and certifiable for SIL4 software applications for signalling equipment (Certification itself is not part of the project)
\end{enumerate}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: The goals shall be reformulated to respect the fromulations and priorties definded at Paris.}

\subsection{Intended Audience}
\textit{Proposed Content: This document applies to the whole development life-cycle of the project and it addresses all the stakeholders involved in the project. This document should be available to all of them in read access mode and it provides operational guidance and access to QA procedures.}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: The part " should be available to all of them in read access mode '' shall be deleted, since this is clear and always given in an open project public repository.}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: at the following part "for all people participating in the OpenETCS project. The formulation"operational guidance and access to QA procedures'' should be clearified and extended on.}

\subsection{Evolution}
\textit{Proposed content: Frequency, method, responsibilities,{\dots}}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: Please at an example, as I don't see the purpose of this part.}

\textit{Proposed Content: Refer to Annex with the Role/Competence Matrix at project level.
Besides, in this chapter,  outline or refer to the procedure that will be used to maintain this matrix up to date; identify (refer and/or outline) the measures and/or mechanisms in place to record the competencies of the personnel assigned to the different roles (i.e. each company has to maintain training records) and measures and/or mechanisms to identify and fill gaps (i.e.maintain a project specific incorporation programme; maintain a training programme)}

\subsection{Roles within the Development process of the openETCS Software}
\textit{Proposed Content: Refer to Annex with the Role/Competence Matrix of the OpenETCS software. 
Besides in this chapter, outline key specific competences demanded by the ETCS software development to the different roles.}

\subsection{QA Activities}

\textit{Proposed Content: Describe the measures applied to monitor/verify people assigned to the different roles meet the requirements imposed by the role and have an active/qualified participation to the project (i.e. committers: assess effective contribution activities; gap analysis;{\dots}).}

\section{Methods, measures and tools for quality assurance (product + open ETCS software + Tools chain) + Justification of chosen Tools and Methods}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: The Annex does/can not provide the needed information. Teh references have to be made to the WP 2 and WP3 deliverables, which actually provide these information in depth}

\textit{Proposed Content: Refer to Annex where for each phase in the development life-cycle identify methods and tools as well as justification for selection}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: There should be again sections for the openETCS modell, software (are the product) and Tools chain.}

\subsection{QA Activities}
\textit{Proposed Content: Describe the measures to monitor the appropriate implementation of the selected methods and tools.}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: This is a broad topic, the main issues will be covered by the verification, validation and safety plan. This aspect should introduce the general principals and tools and then reference those documents.}

\section{Documentation}

\subsection{Documentation Structure within the development process of the openETCS Software}
\textit{Proposed Content: Prepare a separate document with a complete description of labelling; definitions and acronyms; control information to include in each document; documents QA criteria; documentation matrix}

\subsection{Documentation Structure within the development process of the openETCS Tools chain}
\textit{Proposed Content: See Chapter 6.1}

\subsection{QA Activities}
\textit{Proposed Content: Describe the methods to review the documentation structure}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: For me this should not be the review of the dcumentation structure, but the documentation quality control activities. These are looked at in detail over the next to chapters, therefore this should be a genereal overview.}

\section{Documentation Control}
\textit{Proposed Content: Refer to Review Process Document where the function develop by authors, reviewers is provider}
\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: This sentence is hard to understand. From my point of view the three section make no sence sice there should be the same process for all kinds of documents. This section should name the main control activities (review, approval, dissermination, archiving) and the main tools used for this. Then it should refer do the respecitive documents (like the great review process).}

\subsection{Documentation Control within the Development process of the openETCS Sotware}

\textit{Proposed Content: Refer to the specific procedure. }

\textit{Describe the QA activities}

\subsection{Modification and change control }
\textit{Proposed Content: Refer to external procedure; Overview table with the summary of main features of the procedure.}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: What is meant with "external procedures"? This topic is closely related to the document related responsabilities and the github use. Therefore it is very close to the Configuration Management, which maybe makes it hard to seperate these topics.}

\textit{describe the QA activities to be developed.}

\section{Supplier Control}
\textit{Proposed Content: Requirements to external suppliers and how they will be verified}

\todo[color=yellow!20, inline]{JW: What are the suppliers in OpenETCs and what activities are needed here?}
